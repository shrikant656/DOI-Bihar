      <p class="big_txt"><span>Bihar is one of the fastest growing states in India.</span> During the period 2005-06 to 2014-15, the GSDP of Bihar at constant prices grew annually at 10.5 percent, which is one of the highest among all major Indian states. </p>
      <p>The scale and pace of economic change that Bihar has witnessed over the past few years has been the result of a comprehensive, home-grown reform program initiated by the government. These reforms ranged from changes in managing public finance and reforming government expenditures, public investments in building infrastructure, and most importantly revamping the law and order machinery. All these changes have provided an enabling environment for private investment in the state and greater industry commitment.</p>
      <p>Bihar has a unique location specific advantage because of its proximity to the vast markets of eastern and northern India, access to ports such as Kolkata and Haldia and to raw material sources and mineral reserves from the neighbouring states. Bihar is primarily an agrarian state and is one of the largest producers of vegetables and fruits in India. Bihar is endowed with water resources – both ground and surface water – asit receives an average rainfall of 1009 mm each year. Ganga is the main river that flows through the state, joined by tributaries that originate in the Himalayas. Some of the other major rivers are Saryu, Gandak, Budhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla and Mahananda. The state has a large base of cost effective, industrial labour, making it an ideal destination for a wide range of industries. </p>
